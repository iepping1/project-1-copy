# Project 1

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

This is a web app for looking up and reviewing Books.

The application file handles all the functions, allowing you to login, register, search for books, look up bookinfo and review/rate those books.

The helpers file adds a few extra functions to smooth out the site with apologies and requirements. This was taken from finance mostly.

Book.csv has all the required information on books: isbn, year of publication, author and of course the book's title.

The import file is used to take all the book data from the csv and add it to the SQL table.

Requirements.txt holds all the names for the necessary flask tools.

The templates folder houses the html for the site itself. There are six pages in total: the login/register screen, the search index, the booklist, the detailed book info and an apology screen. A general layout html file is used for all other html files to homogenize their designs.

The static folder holds the css file which gives the site its style.
